<h2 id="4-children-s-use-of-the-platforms-">4. Children&#39;s Use of the Platforms.</h2>
<p>SteveyMcGuy has developed its apps to be an enjoyable experience for users of all ages. Whenever we refer to children in this Privacy Policy, we mean children under the age of 13, unless otherwise indicated.
SteveyMcGuy complies with the Children&#39;s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), a U.S. law designed to protect the online privacy of children. SteveyMcGuy takes precautions designed to protect the online privacy of children, and we encourage parents to take an active role in protecting their children&#39;s privacy by discussing this Privacy Policy with them.
SteveyMcGuy does not knowingly collect personal information as defined by COPPA from children (or adults) through its apps. If we learn or have reason to suspect that we have collected personal information from a child in violation of COPPA, we will promptly delete it.

<h2 id="5-links-">5. Links.</h2>
<p>If you click on a link to a website, platform, or service not controlled by us, including on an advertisement or an ad provider link, you will leave the SteveyMcGuy Platform you are visiting and go to the site you selected. These other entities may use Tracking Technologies to independently collect information about you and may solicit information from you. Because we cannot control the activities of other entities, we cannot accept responsibility for any use of your information by such entities, and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy and security practices as SteveyMcGuy. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these other entities from whom you request services. If you visit a website, platform, or service that is linked to on a Budge Studios Platform, you should consult that site&#39;s privacy policy before providing any information on that site.
